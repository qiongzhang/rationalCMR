These experiments studied serial postion effects under conditions
designed to minimize rehearsal.  Experiment 1 has immediate and delayed 
free recall.  Experiment 2 has continuous distractor free recall
in 4 conditions that vary in the length of the IPI.  For further
information, analysis code, contact Marc Howard.

The format of the data here is as follows:

    Each trial has five lines.
    The first line gives 
	Subject trial cumulative_trial	(Experiment 1)
	Subject session trial condition		(Experiment 2)
    The second line gives the indices of the words in the list in the Toronto Noun Pool.
    The third line gives the serial position of each response.    
    The fourth line gives the index in the Toronto Noun Pool of the response.
    The fifth line gives the IRT in ms.

    A serial position of -99 means the response was not presented to the
	subject in that session.
    A serial position of -n (Experiment 1) means that the response was
	presented n lists prior.
    A serial position of -n x 100 -m (Experiment 2) means that the response
	was presented n lists back, where it occupied serial position m.
    A noun pool index of 481 is an extra-list intrusion.
    
Files:

Immed.dat  Experiment 1, immediate.
Delay.dat  Experiment 1, delayed.

Experiment 2: Ltr0.dat, Ltr1.dat, Ltr2.dat, Ltr3.dat are IPI conditions 0, 2, 8 and 16 s respectively.

ltr-nounpool.txt is the nounpool used in this study.
